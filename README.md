# MazeSolver

This project uses computer vision to scan a 2D maze, preprocess and finally sove it. The solved maze is then used to navigate an arduino based robot from a start point to an end point.
-The circuit was created and simulated in proteus.
-The program to scan and solve the maze was written in Python 
-The simulation of the robot was done in MATLAB - Simulink
