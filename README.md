# MazeSolver

- This project uses computer vision to scan a 2D maze
- Preprocess and finally solve it. The solved maze is then used to navigate an arduino based robot from a start point to an end point.
- The circuit was created and simulated in proteus.
- The program to scan and solve the maze was written in Python 
- The simulation of the robot was done in MATLAB - Simulink
